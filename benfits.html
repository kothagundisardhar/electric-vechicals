    <p class="pnew">Transport is a fundamental requirement of modern life, but the traditional combustion engine is quickly becoming outdated. Petrol or diesel vehicles are highly polluting and are being quickly replaced by fully electric vehicles. Fully electric vehicles (EV) have zero tailpipe emissions and are much better for the environment. The electric vehicle revolution is here, and you can be part of it. Will your next vehicle be an electric one?</p>

                <p>The running cost of an electric vehicle is much lower than an equivalent petrol or diesel vehicle. Electric<br>
                    vehicles use electricity to charge their batteries instead of using fossil fuels like petrol or diesel.<br>
                    Electric vehicles are more efficient, and that combined with the electricity cost means that charging <br>
                    an electricvehicle is cheaper than filling petrol or diesel for your travel requirements. Using renewable <br>
                    energy sources can make the use of electric vehicles more eco-friendly. The electricity cost can be reduced<br>
                    further if charging is done with the help of renewable energy sources installed at home, such as solar panels.

            <td><h1>_____ Petrol and diesel use is destroying our planet</h1>
                <p>The availability of fossil fuels is limited, and their use is destroying our planet. Toxic emissions from <br>
                    petrol and diesel vehicles lead to long-term, adverse effects on public health. The emissions impact of <br>
                     vehicles is much lower than petrol or diesel vehicles. From an efficiency perspective, electric vehicles <br>
                      can covert around 60% of the electrical energy from the grid to power the wheels, but petrol or diesel cars <br>
                       can only convert 17%-21% of the energy stored in the fuel to the wheels. That is a waste of around 80%. <br>
                        Fully electric vehicles have zero tailpipe emissions, but even when electricity production is taken into <br>
                         account, petrol or diesel vehicles emit almost 3 times more carbon dioxide than the average EV. To reduce <br>
                          the impact of charging electric vehicles, India is ambitious to achieve about 40 percent cumulative electric <br>
                           power installed capacity from non-fossil fuel-based energy resources by the year 2030. Therefore, electric <br>
                            vehicles are the way forward for Indian transport, and we must switch to them now.

                These problems can easily be overcome with an electric vehicle. Simply plug your vehicle in at your home <br>
                charger for 4-5 hours before you plan to go. If you are able to get a charger where you park at home, it is <br>
                 very convenient to plan your journeys in advance. What if you forget to plug in your machine someday? Then <br>
                you can easily take the help of fast chargers or even battery swapping services if you are on a two-wheeler on the road.
