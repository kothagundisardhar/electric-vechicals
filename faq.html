    <h1>Electric Vehicle</h1>
    <h3>What is an Electric Vehicle?</h3>
    <p>An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle that is powered by an electric motor and a battery, which can be recharged by plugging it into a fast-charging socket and a standard electrical socket as well.</p>
    <h3>What are the different types of Electric Vehicles available?</h3>
    <p>There are four types of electric vehicles (EVs) available: <br>

        Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV): Fully powered by electricity. These are the more efficient compared to hybrid and plug-in hybrids. <br>
        
        Hybrid Electric Vehicle: <br>
        
        Hybrid Electric Vehicle (HEV): The vehicle uses both, the internal combustion (usually petrol) engine, and the battery powered motor powertrain. The petrol engine is used both to drive and charge when the battery is drained. These vehicles are not as efficient as fully electric or plug in hybrid vehicles. <br>
        
        Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV): Uses both an internal combustion engine and a battery charged from an external socket (they have a plug). This means the vehicle’s battery can be charged with electricity rather than the engine. PHEVs are more efficient than HEVs but less efficient than BEVs. <br>
        
        Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle (FCEV): Electrical energy is produced from fuel cell stacks which converts hydrogen to electricity. <br>
        
        To know more about how these electric vehicles work,</p>
    <h3>Do Electric Vehicles drive differently to conventional vehicles?</h3>
    <p>An electric car is silent, with the sound of running motor audible only at high speeds. Aside from that, electric vehicles are relatively easy to operate and drive like a conventional car with an automatic transmission. But, unlike an automatic, they have a lot of 'torque' from a standstill, making them incredibly responsive.</p>
    <h3>How do I know which electric car is right for me?</h3>
    <p>Electric vehicles are quickly becoming an affordable option for everyone. Moreover, the central/state government provides an upfront subsidy that further reduces the overall costs. The choose my EV selector tool will help you to look for an electric vehicle to cater to your requirements.</p>
    <h1>Electric Vehicle Charging</h1>
    <h3>Where can I charge my Electric Vehicle?</h3>
    <p>The two most typical locations for charging an electric vehicle are at home and at work. Public charging stations can be a useful alternative for electric vehicle users who do not have access to a home or workplace charger, a simple method to top-up on occasion, or a necessity for ‘en-route' charging for longer excursions.</p>
    <h3>How much does it cost to charge an electric vehicle on public charging locations?</h3>
    <p>The cost of charging an electric vehicle at a public charging station varies substantially based on the amount of charge necessary, the cost of power in each network, and the type of public charging station utilized. Some will cost very less to use, whereas quick/rapid charging will often be more expensive than fast charging due to the convenience and greater capital costs.</p>
    <h1>Business</h1>
    <h3>Name some manufacturers that I can collaborate with to build my business around their offerings?</h3>
    <p>Till 31 July 2021, there were 380 electric vehicle manufacturers in India. With the increasing adoption of Electric Vehicles in the landscape, this number is only expected to increase further.</p>
    <h3>Are startups interested in tapping the electric mobility space in India?</h3>
    <p>As India’s electric vehicle market is approaching the inflection point of price parity, the interest of Indian users in electric vehicles is higher than ever before. Startups along various components of the electric vehicle value chain, including manufacturing, retail, battery swapping, and software services, are disrupting the existing structure of the auto industry.

        While the emerging firms continue to face an uphill challenge in competing with the existing giants of the transportation industry, they are increasingly making their presence felt in the still-undefined consumer market. Furthermore, the integration of emerging technologies, including AI, analytics, and machine learning, has put them at a position of technological superiority as compared to their conventional vehicle counterparts.
        
        Startups have identified the merits of electric vehicles and related services and are ahead in the curve to offer these benefits to the consumers by making the adoption further easier for them. They have banked upon the fact that the future is Electric as e-mobility will aid the country in reducing the carbon intensity and enable users to opt for a cheaper alternative for fuel. They understand that the shift to electric vehicle is bound to happen as electric vehicles are economical, convenient and environment friendly and therefore, are playing a pivotal role in the evolving electric mobility space in India.
        
        At present, there are 399 electric vehicle startups in India.</p>
    <h1>Safety</h1>
    <h3>Are electric vehicle batteries safe?</h3>
    <p>Electric vehicles are generally run by high-energy-density Lithium-ion batteries. Statistically, the risk of them catching fire and exploding is minimal. Notwithstanding, it is paramount to ensure that the electric vehicles follow the battery safety standards such as AIS 048. AIS 048 includes safety tests for protection against short-circuit and overcharging of the batteries. It comprises of electrical tests such as short circuit test (cell level or battery module or battery pack), overcharge test (cell level or battery module or battery pack), shock test, roll-over test (battery module) (applicable only for flooded lead-acid batteries) among others to rule out fire/explosion events.<br>
        Battery safety can be enhanced through multiple mechanisms including: <br>

Division of battery packs into arrays and cell isolation in order to reduce the potential damage whenever a malfunction takes place. <br>

Utilization of a cooling mechanism to maintain the EV battery at a low and safe temperature. <br>

IP rated tough casings (ranging from IP 65 to IP 68) to provide dust and water protection to the external packaging of the battery pack and all electrical systems. <br>

Utilization of a battery management system to continuously monitor the battery pack’s temperature and health. The battery management system is capable of preventing events like ‘thermal runaway’. <br>

Precautionary measures need to be undertaken by the electric vehicle professionals working with high voltage electric vehicle batteries to minimize the potential risks. The employers are liable to ensure the safety of employees and are mandated to adhere to Occupational Safety and Health Standard e.g. OSHA 1910.132 and equivalent Indian standards created by BIS. Besides, they also need to ensure that the employees receive necessary safety trainings and have access to PPE kits for working in an environment with safety risks. <br></p>
<h3>Are electric vehicles as safe to drive as other vehicles?</h3>
<p>Electric vehicles are subjected to the same rigorous safety testing as conventional vehicles and must meet the same safety standards and homologation criteria, as well as additional electric vehicle-specific requirements. Similar to Europe, and in some cases more so, ARAI has established a comprehensive methodology for battery testing as well as vehicle testing of batteries (for example, cells in India need to pass the nail penetration test). Vehicle and battery makers must also have extra system design redundancies in place in addition to the tests.</p>
